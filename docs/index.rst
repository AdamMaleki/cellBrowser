The UCSC Cell Browser is a viewer for single cell data. You can click on and
hover over cells to get meta information, search for genes to color on and
click clusters to show cluster-specific marker genes, which in turn are
clickable again.

The main live of the cell browser with various CIRM and HCA datasets is
http://cells.ucsc.edu, but you can create one for your own data on your
own webserver, as documented below.

The UCSC cell browser is funded by grants from the California Institute of Regenerative Medicine
and the Chan-Zuckerberg Initiative https://www.chanzuckerberg.com/.
